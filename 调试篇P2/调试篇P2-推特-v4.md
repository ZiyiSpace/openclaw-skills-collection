**🧵 Thread (1/2) - Tested 20 Debug Skills, Only 5 Are Worth It**

Tested 20+ OpenClaw Debug Skills over 2 weeks.
Only 5 are worth installing. Here's the truth 👇

**Why I did this?**

Last month, hit a production 503 error.
- ❌ Added `console.log` everywhere (log spam, couldn't find issue)
- ❌ Restarted service blindly (couldn't reproduce)
- ❌ Read code for 3 days (still clueless)

Boss panicked, users complained, I lost hair 🤦‍♂️

**🏆 TOP3 Debug Skills**

**🥇 No.1: debug-pro**
"Systematic debugging methodology"
- 3-day bug → 30-minute fix (+400%)
- Hypothesis-driven, not guessing
- Works across languages

Install: `npx clawhub@latest install debug-pro`

---

**🥈 No.2: log-analyzer**
"Analyze massive logs in minutes"
- 100K logs → 3 minutes to find issue
- Auto-detects stack traces, null pointers
- Timeline visualization

Install: `npx clawhub@latest install log-analyzer`

**🥉 No.3: dns-networking**
"Network debugging made easy"
- DNS resolution issues in 3 minutes
- No more `ping`/`telnet` guessing
- Connects the dots

Install: `npx clawhub@latest install dns-networking`

---

**Real-World Results:**

- Production 503: 3 days → 30 min (+400%)
- Memory leak: 6 hours → 30 min (+300%)
- Network issue: 1 hour → 3 min (+200%)

---

**🎁 Bonus 2 Skills:**

4️⃣ **container-debug** - Debug Docker containers
5️⃣ **log-tail** - Real-time log monitoring

**One-Command Install:**

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install debug-pro log-analyzer dns-networking container-debug log-tail
```

---

**⚠️ What to Avoid:**

❌ Single-language debugging tools (too limited)
❌ Complex setup (no time during debugging)
❌ Paid tools (free alternatives exist)
❌ Console.log spam (systematic approach wins)
